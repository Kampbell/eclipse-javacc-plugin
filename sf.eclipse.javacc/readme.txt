Bugs and caveats.

1) The option OUTPUT_DIR doesn't work for JJDoc.
This is a bug in JJDOC.
Try directly from the console :
>jjdoc -OUTPUT_DIRECTORY:doc new_file.jj
Java Compiler Compiler Version 3.2 (Documentation Generator Version 0.1.4)
(type "jjdoc" with no arguments for help)
Reading from file new_file.jj . . .
Grammar documentation generated successfully in new_file.html

The "new_file.html" has not been generated in "doc" directory !
We should have read : "generated successfully in doc/new_file.html"

Workaround : you can use the -OUTPUT_FILE option :
>jjdoc -OUTPUT_FILE:doc/doc.html new_file.jj
Java Compiler Compiler Version 3.2 (Documentation Generator Version 0.1.4)
(type "jjdoc" with no arguments for help)
Reading from file new_file.jj . . .
Grammar documentation generated successfully in doc/doc.html

Unfortunatly then you have to specify this option for each file
you compile with JJDoc.

The plugin is ready for the correction; it passes both options
when invoking JJDoc.

2) *.jj files are copied in bin directory
It is a feature of Eclipse which copies all files which are not *.java.
You have the choice to make Eclipse copy or not copy theses files.
You can disable copy of .jj and .jjt files with :
Menu "Window" -> "Preferences"
Choose "Java" -> "Compiler" then "Build path" tab and add in
Filtered Resources : *.jj,*.jjt
