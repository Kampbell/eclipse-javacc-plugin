
README for the javacc eclipse plugin v0.8.0

NOTE: THIS IS A VERY EARLY RELEASE.  IT ISN'T FEATURE COMPLETE
AND HAS KNOWN ISSUES.  USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK.

LICENSE:  This software is distributed under the 
Lesser/Library GNU Public License.  


TO INSTALL:

1) Unzip the plugin distribution zip file into your 
   Eclipse installation's plugin directory.  You should
   end up with a plugin directory called 
   com.subx.eclipse.javacc_<version>.

2) Due to licensing restrictions, you will need to download 
   the JavaCC library yourself and manually put it into the
   plugin directory as follows:

	a) Goto http://www.webgain.com/products/java_cc/
	b) Follow instructions to download and unpack the JavaCC tool.
	c) Copy the JavaCC.zip file from the JavaCC install directory:
		<javacc_install>/bin/lib into the unpacked plugin directory.
		
3) At this stage of development, you will manually need to edit the 
   project files of projects you wish to use the javacc-plugin with.
   	
   	a) quit Eclipse
   	b) open the .project file that lives in your project's directory
   	c) insert the following XML at the beginning of the <buildSpec> tag
   	   children;
   	   
   	   <buildSpec>
   			<buildCommand>
			    <name>com.subx.eclipse.javacc.Builder</name>
			    <arguments>
			    </arguments>
		    </buildCommand>
		    
		    <!-- other buildCommand entries here -->
		    
	   </buildSpec>
	   
4) Create .jj files in your project's source tree.  In general, 
   I create and maintain the jj files in the package in which the 
   resulting parser is generated.  The plugin will, once the .jj file
   is discovered (at save time), create a new source folder called 
   _generated.  Files in this folder will be the results of the generation
   of the parser.  You should not maintain the _gnerated folder in your
   source control system as it is entirely generated from the .jj file. 
   Every time you change and save the .jj file, the parser will be regenerated
   and recompiled.
   
NOTES:
	a) This version does not support jjtree and all of the AST stuff - only
	   straight .jj grammars
	b) The error reporting is not always wired up properly.  Some errors get 
	   'dropped' and don't show up as errors in the task list, etc.
	c) Sometimes things get wildly out of sync and you need to either restart
	   Eclipse, Refresh the project and/or Rebuild the project.
