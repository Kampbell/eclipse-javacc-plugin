<h1>Console for JavaCC ouput</h1>

<p>To show the Console use menu "Window" -&gt; "Show
View" -&gt; "Other..."&nbsp; and choose "JavaCC Console" <br>
</p>

<p>The console may help understand the error reported in the
"Problems" tab.<br>
For example :</p>

<p>1) JJTree reports a warning but doesn't give the line number.<br>
The plugin is only parsing the JavaCC output, and cannot find a
non-existent information, so<strong> the warning will not be
reported</strong>.</p>

<p>2) JavaCC reports another warning about "Lookahead adequacy
checking not being performed..."<br>
which <strong>is not reported </strong>as it is not containing
any line number.</p>

<p><img src="javacc_console.png"><br></p>
<p>
There is a context menu on the text in the console, limited to
"Clear" and "Copy".<br>
You cannot use the console to launch JavaCC, this console is a just a text
view, not an editor, not a Shell.</p>
